        <h3>Objective Statement</h3>
        <p>
            I seek to minimize the negative environmental impact of buildings through improved
            efficiency and moderation in the use of materials, energy, development space and the
            ecosystem at large. This is achived through the use of conscious approach to energy
            and ecological conservation through every stage of the design process and through to the project completion.
